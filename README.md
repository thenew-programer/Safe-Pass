# First React App I build
# Pass Manager
it's an app that manages your password, and store them in an sql db. I built it using `nodejs` and `express` in the backend and `React` for the front-end.

## Usage
**[Go to this Link]()**
### Add password
provede the `website`, `email or username`, and `password` and click save credentials.
### My Password
go to my passwords to see all the password that you added, unfortunately you'll see every password added because I only use one table, maybe in the future I will add more stuff, like user login and authentification.
### Remove Pass
Go to remove pass if you want to remove a passowrd.
